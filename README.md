## Project Overview:

### Purpose:
Crypto Trader is a simulated cryptocurrency trading application designed to provide users with a realistic trading experience. Utilising the MERN stack and the TradingView Lite Charting Library, this application offers a robust platform for users to manage their cryptocurrency portfolios, execute trades, monitor their investment performance, and experience trading without the risk of actual financial loss.

### Real-World Problem:
Cryptocurrency trading can be complex and intimidating for new traders. There is a high risk of financial loss due to market volatility and lack of experience. Crypto Trader aims to solve this problem by providing a risk-free simulated trading environment where users can practice and hone their trading skills. By offering realistic trading features and portfolio management tools, users can learn how to analyze market trends, make informed trading decisions, and manage their investments effectively without the fear of losing real money.
